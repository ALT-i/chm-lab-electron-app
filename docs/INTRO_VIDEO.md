# Introductory Video Feature

This document explains the introductory video feature that plays every time a user logs into the CHM Lab application, and the enhanced About screen that includes comprehensive information and video access.

## Overview

The introductory video feature provides a welcoming experience for users by playing a video that introduces them to the Chemistry Lab application. The video plays automatically after successful login and before the user reaches the main application. Additionally, users can access the intro video and detailed application information through the enhanced About screen.

## How It Works

### 1. Login Flow
When a user successfully logs in:
1. The system checks if `intro_video_seen` flag is set in localStorage
2. If not set, user is redirected to `/intro-video` route
3. If already set, user goes directly to `/home`

### 2. Video Playback
- Video starts playing automatically (configurable)
- Skip button appears after configured delay
- User can skip or watch the entire video

### 3. Completion
- When video ends or user skips, `intro_video_seen` flag is set
- User is automatically redirected to the main application
- Flag persists until logout

### 4. Logout Reset
When user logs out:
- `intro_video_seen` flag is cleared
- User will see intro video again on next login

### 5. Manual Replay
Users can replay the intro video through:
- Side panel "Intro Video" menu option
- About screen "Introduction Video" tab
- Utility functions (for developers)
